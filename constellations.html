    <h2>What is a constellation?</h2>
    <p>A constellation is a group of stars in the night sky that form a specific shape. The word comes from the Latin word constellātiō, which can be translated as “set with stars.” Astrology used this term at first for asterisms that were noted by Ammianus Marcellinus in the 4th century – they believed that all of them have a certain influence on humankind. The term, however, was not used that often before the 16th century. </p>

    <p> It is shown later on that the constellations are much larger than the asterisms in the night sky, and the borders of all constellations were redefined in 1922. by International Astronomical Union.</p>
